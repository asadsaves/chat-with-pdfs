Chat with PDFs
You can find the project repository on GitHub: https://github.com/asadsaves/chat-with-pdfs.

Introduction
Chat with PDFs is a Python application that allows users to interact with the content of multiple PDF documents through natural language queries. By asking questions, the application provides relevant responses based on the content of the uploaded PDFs. This app leverages advanced language models to generate accurate answers to user queries. Please note that the application only responds to questions related to the loaded PDF documents.

How It Works
The application operates through a sequence of steps:

PDF Loading: Users upload multiple PDF files, and the application reads and extracts the text from each document.

Text Chunking: The extracted text is broken into smaller, manageable chunks for effective processing.

Language Model Processing: A language model is used to create vector embeddings for each text chunk, allowing semantic comparisons.

Similarity Matching: When a user asks a question, the app matches the query with the text chunks to find the most semantically similar ones.

Response Generation: The selected text chunks are passed back to the language model, which generates an answer based on the relevant content from the PDFs.

Dependencies and Installation
To install and run the Chat with PDFs app, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/asadsaves/chat-with-pdfs.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd chat-with-pdfs
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Obtain an API key from OpenAI and add it to the .env file in the project directory:

bash
Copy code
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_secret_api_key
Usage
To start using the Chat with PDFs app:

Ensure that all dependencies are installed and the OpenAI API key is correctly set in the .env file.

Launch the application by running the following command in your terminal:

bash
